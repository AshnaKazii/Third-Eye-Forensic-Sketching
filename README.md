PURPOSE:
The purpose of "Third Eye Forensic Sketching – A New Era in Crime Investigation" is to revolutionize the crime-solving process by empowering victims to create forensic sketches themselves, using a user- friendly, web-based app. This app includes intuitive drag-and-drop functionality, making it accessible even for users without artistic skills. Once a sketch is completed, the app automatically searches a database
of known criminals for potential matches. If a match is not found, the "Third Eye Forensic Sketching" app will automatically add the newly created sketch to the database, enhancing future search capabilities and continuously improving the system’s ability to assist in identifying criminals. This ensures the database grows over time, becoming more comprehensive and effective for crime investigations.
